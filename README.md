# Invention Dice

I made this project as a brainstorming tool inspired by a video from Atomic Shrimp on YouTube. He made some wooden dice with different attributes/characteristics on them for the purpose of brainstorming inventions.
I thought this was a fun idea, and wanted to make an iOS app based on this concept in order to learn how to use the CoreData framework for data persistence.

## Features
- Roll dice that give you different characteristics
- Save dicerolls to a list

## Notes
This app is unfinished and no longer maintained, but it was a great learning experience in:
- iOS app architecture
- CoreData implementation
- Building a functional prototype from concept to code

It also helped me develop a better understanding of user interaction and feature scoping in app design.
